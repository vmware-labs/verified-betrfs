CREATING YOUR CGROUP
--------------------

You need to do this only once.

  sudo cgcreate -a <your-userid>:<your-groupid> -t <your-userid>:<your-groupid> -g <class>:<your-cgroup-name>

The -a gives you permission to edit the configuration of the
cgroup.  If you don't use -a, then you will need to become root
any time you want to change the configuration of your cgroup.

The -t gives you permission to put processes in the cgroup.  If
you don't use -t, then you will need to become root any time you
want to run a program in your cgroup.

<class> is like "memory" or "cpu".  See the cgroup docs.

CONFIGURING YOUR CGROUP
-----------------------

To set/change some limit of your cgroup:

  echo <value> > /sys/fs/cgroup/<class>/<your-cgroup-name>/<some-limit>

RUNNING COMMANDS IN YOUR CGROUP
-------------------------------

  cgexec -g <class>:<your-cgroup-name> <cmd> <args>


DELETING YOUR CGROUP
--------------------

  sudo cgdelete -g <class>:<your-cgroup-name>


EXAMPLE
-------

To run "ls" with all physical ram usage limited to 1000KB:

sudo cgcreate -a robj:robj -t robj:robj -g memory:robs-cgroup
echo 1024000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/robs-cgroup/memory.limit_in_bytes
cgexec -g memory:robs-cgroup ls
