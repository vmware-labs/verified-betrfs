 - Better module abstraction.
    - This works as long as you keep your chain of abstract modules
      linear, although it's a bit of a pain.
    - If you try to have a diamond
      of abstract module inclusions, everything falls apart because you have
      no way to specify that the two inclusions of the same abstract module
      are the same.

- Better state machine abstraction.
    - State machine refinement is not the same as Dafny module refinement.
      If I build state machine X using state machine Y as a subcomponent,
      and then I create refinement Y' of Y, I can't automatically get an X'
      which has Y replaced with Y'. Instead I have to write a lot of boilerplate.
