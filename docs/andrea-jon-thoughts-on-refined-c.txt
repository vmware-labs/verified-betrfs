Andrea & Jon synthesizing thoughts about Michael Sammler's Refined C.

typing rules could become a big user-searched forest
  - analogy to scala, where you have to dig around the entire code base
  - in rust, the borrow rules are less powerful, but the same everywhere
  - likely difficult to generate meaningful error messages; users will need
    a huge mental vocabulary to debug "can't unify type" error message.

the power lattice
  - extra power to capture uninit (retyped) memory. GC.
    - is this actually frequent?
  - used the uninit "hammer" to do ownership types too; is there a better choice?
    - more powerful type systems come with worse diagnostics. Reaching for the
      more-powerful type system for everything means worse diagnostics for
      everything.

  - dependent-typing might remove some proof obligations high in the stack for
    functional semantics.
  - refinement vs dependent types? -- there are decidable dependent type systems
    - WF goes into decidable-dependent type
    - or would this require the user to do type-juggling to dispatch these things?

the functional language is Coq
  - which didn't look fun
what RC ideas might we adopt if we didn't attach ourselves to Coq
  - if we used newtypes (dafny dependent types) aggressively, would that be pretty
    close to RC?
    - not quite -- RC uses "type constructors", so a refined type has as many smaller
      types as parameter choices.
- Dafny is awesome because the proof language and the implementation language are the same.
  - at least, this reduces lots of syntatic glue boilerplate
  - much easier to make meaningful diagnostics
  - so maybe this just means that Dafny is "mature" or "well-cooked", and we're constrasting
    it with a bunch of duct-taped prototypes.
